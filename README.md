## dot files
Everything starts with configuring your development environment.

So dot files play a role when setting up your MAC or Linux system. As many before I'm creating my own dot files repository by analysing and adapting good solutions that already exists. My main reference is the dot files repository from [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish). Find his repository [here](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles).

### Setup
#### installing
Use the command collection in <code>setup-machine.sh</code> to prepare the system to use these dot files. Before executing read the content of the file <code>setup-machine.sh</code>.

After this link or copy the files to your home directory. For the <code>.gitconfig</code> file it is necessary to add your Git's user configuration <code>user.name, user.email</code>
